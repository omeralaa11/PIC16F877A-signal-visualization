# PIC16F877A Signal Visualization

This project demonstrates real-time signal acquisition and visualization using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. Analog signals are read via the microcontroller's ADC, transmitted over UART, and visualized using a Processing-based desktop application. This setup is ideal for educational purposes, signal analysis, and embedded systems experimentation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Signal Acquisition**: The PIC16F877A reads analog input signals using its built-in 10-bit ADC.
2. **Data Transmission**: The digitized signal values are sent over UART to a connected PC.
3. **Real-Time Visualization**: The Processing application receives the data and plots the signal waveform in real-time, providing a visual representation of the analog input.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Microcontroller Setup

* Open the `project/` folder in mikroC PRO for PIC.
* Compile and upload the code to the PIC16F877A microcontroller.
* Ensure the analog signal source is connected to the appropriate ADC input pin.

### 2. PC Visualization

* Open `processing IDE code.pde` in the Processing IDE.
* Modify the serial port settings in the code to match your system's configuration.
* Run the Processing sketch to start visualizing incoming data.([Gist][4])

### 3. Simulation (Optional)

* Use `Simulation circuit.jpg` as a reference to recreate the circuit in Proteus.
* Load the compiled `.hex` file into the PIC16F877A component within Proteus.
* Run the simulation to test the system virtually.([GitHub][2])
